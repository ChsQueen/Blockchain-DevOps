# Bitcoin/Ethereum DevOps Monitoring Challenge
------

Companies today are working on building monitoring solutions to have better insight on the health and performance of their computing systems. Your challenge today is to set up a monitoring stack to capture a Bitcoin or Ethereum or your favorite Blockchain network CLI runningfrom two live EC2 instances!  

**All tools and AWS services are** â€‹ **FREE! IF YOU USE T2.MICRO EC2 INSTANCES**
Enjoyed the challenge? Intrested in Insight? Send a PDF containing your dashboarding running to devops@insightconsensus.com with the subject "Berkeley Blockchain-DevOps" .

#### Tips On Getting Started:

* Dive Deep into tools! Then build fast!
* Find resources online.
* Keep it in the cloud.
* Automate simulations.

#### Monitoring Challenge + Starting Resources:

1. Set up 3 t2.micro AWS EC2 instances (you may have to up the size to handle the CLI)
    * What is AWS? [(link)](https://youtu.be/qcY-uiEHhn0)
    * How to create an AWS account. [(link)](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
    * Launching and ssh-ing into your first EC2 instance. [(link)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/vmlaunch/step-1-launch-instance.html) [(link)](https://youtu.be/BCM9aaaWvR0)
         * Bash commands and scripting 101 [(link)](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners) 
    * Install your preferred blockchain node CLI on 2 EC2 instances.
2. Configure Prometheus to monitor 2 EC2 instances.
    * What is Prometheus? [(link)](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
3. Connect Prometheus to Grafana.
    * What is Grafana? [(link)](https://grafana.com/grafana/)
4. Collect and display cpu, memory, and disk space usage.
5. Use your monitored nodes (EC2 instances) to begin validating transactions on the given testnet.

#### Optional:
*  Collect and display network traffic rate, upload rate, and download rate.
